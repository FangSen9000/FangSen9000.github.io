<p>Due to the large volume of emails that I receive, I generally do not respond to unsolicited inquiries about student or postdoc openings; please apply through Courant or CDS programs. Nevertheless, if you have a strong quantitative background and think your interests are compatible with mine, please feel free to contact me.</p>
